# 🎮 Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser

## 🚨 The Situation

You asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit.
It wrote the code, ran away, and now the game is unplayable. 

- You can't win.
- The hints lie to you.
- The secret number seems to have commitment issues.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the broken app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Your Mission

1. **Play the game.** Open the "Developer Debug Info" tab in the app to see the secret number. Try to win.
2. **Find the State Bug.** Why does the secret number change every time you click "Submit"? Ask ChatGPT: *"How do I keep a variable from resetting in Streamlit when I click a button?"*
3. **Fix the Logic.** The hints ("Higher/Lower") are wrong. Fix them.
4. **Refactor & Test.** - Move the logic into `logic_utils.py`.
   - Run `pytest` in your terminal.
   - Keep fixing until all tests pass!

## 📝 Document Your Experience

- [ ] Describe the game's purpose.
- [ ] Detail which bugs you found.
- [ ] Explain what fixes you applied.

## 📸 Demo Walkthrough

Describe your fixed game in numbered steps so a reader can follow along without watching a video:

1. User starts a Normal game with a secret number in the displayed range.
2. User enters a guess below the secret number.
3. Game returns "Too Low" and tells the user to go higher.
4. User enters a guess above the secret number.
5. Game returns "Too High" and tells the user to go lower.
6. User enters the correct guess.
7. The game displays the win message and final score.
8. Selecting New Game resets the score, attempts, history, and secret number.
